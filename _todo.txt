- when registering 
        - check if nick is already taken by someone else and allow
              only unique nicks
        - check if that email is already in use
        - nick, pass and email must be valid inputs (no empty fields)

- user can teleport only within 5 km from his gps coords

- create login and user system

        až já to schválím, jeho účet bude aktivní/použitelný)

- lets say i'm in supermarket and people posted tags about products there
      - i can walk thru place and phone camera sees product packaging and uses 
        it as AR marker on top of which it displays data about the product 
        (other people's experience with product)


- user can style his tag more (like place it vertically like neons on hotels)
            -decide about rotation

        https://jsfiddle.net/sasivarunan/2xLbv7n9/
- map shows me public tags around me
- server filters only tags in circle of 5km and those sends to client
- there could be objects in scene that indicate north (or all NESW sides)
      or lens flare
- najít způsob, jak mít tagz i usery ve sjednocené nadmořské výšce bez chyb
          - android říká že moje výška je 0m, iphone 215 m. do jaké výšky
            postovat tag v tom případě?
          - použít api k získání nadmořské výšky userovy pozice?
cca 8.6. 
- create system to post also images

cca 15.6.
- i can edit my tags
      - it shows me all my tags (the text and latlon or eve address)
      - i choose one to edit and it opens addtagMenu with all data filled in
      - it should also store previous versions of all tags under same _id
- after i clicked on image post, if i only want to post text, i choose text and 
      img div is hidden like at the beginning
      
22.6.
- if gps is turned off, use IP to get at least some gps and warn user about it
- when adding tag - click on the map changes coords in form so user doesnt have 
                  to do it manually
- img upload accepts only image files
